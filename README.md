Game's contents:
By default, the game is set up as a "happy retirement" gift for my mother, who works in healthcare at a hospital.
In this version of the game, she is fleeing the "villain" (Covid-19) as she makes her way home from work to enjoy retirement.
The gift was a real hit! Hope you find similar success in your own iteration.
